                      <p class="about-me-article-body">After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career Path,
                          I've made the big jump over to the Bootcamp to get expert code reviews of my Solo Projects projects and meet like-minded peers.

                    <h2 class="about-me-subtitle">Why I chose frontend development</h2>
                    <p>I’ve always been fascinated by how design meets function.
                      Seeing how a few lines of code can shape something interactive and beautiful really drew me in.
                      Frontend development, for me, is the perfect blend of creativity and logic.
                    </p>
                    <p>I love the instant feedback loop — you write code, and you immediately see it come to life in the browser.
                      That kind of visual progress keeps me motivated and excited to keep learning.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="about-me-subtitle">What motivates me to keep going</h2>
                    <p>Learning to code can feel overwhelming, but I’ve learned that progress is more important than perfection.
                      I stay consistent by setting small, achievable goals each week. 
                      Whether it's building a mini-project or reviewing a concept I struggled with, every step forward counts.
                    </p>
                    <p>Also, being part of the Scrimba community and seeing others share their work inspires me.
                      It reminds me that we're all learning at our own pace, and that’s okay.
                    </p>
