              <p class="main-article-body">After several months of exploring programming on my own, I discovered the Scrimba Frontend Developer Career Path.
                  I’ve decided to fully commit to this journey to become proficient in building modern web applications.

              <h2 class="article-main-subtitle">How I stay committed to learning</h2>
              <p  class="article-main-desc">I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner.
                I used to spend hours and hours learning, then try to create simple projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects.
              </p>
              <p class="article-main-desc">While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and most things about my journey with the world.</p>

              <h2 class="article-main-subtitle">How I got started</h2>
              <p class="article-main-desc">I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site.
                I would take notes about what I was learning. 
                After each learning session, 
                I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short summaries of what I learned using my own words.
              </p>
              <p class="article-main-desc">That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning summaries was also helping others learn and stay motivated.</p>
